        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>If I were to put my goals on a list. Making my parents proud would be the first. My entire life my parents said I have made them proud, but I think it's not good enough. I want to be able to something big, like own a business or get into a good college and have a job that gives me enough money so I won't have to beg my parents for money. I want to be rich and pay my parents back for all the stuff they gave me. Because they always tried their best to make me happy, and I want to do the same for them. </p>

        <p>My second goal would probably be succeeding in life. I don't know what I want to be yet when I grow up. I feel like after a while it would be boring, so my mind just keeps on springing back and forth to other ideas of what I want to be. But I'm sure I'll figure it out before college. </p>
        <p>My third goal would probably have a family of my own. Have a wife, maybe some kids running around, and I wanna be able to make time for my family while I'm still working at my "dream job."</p>
