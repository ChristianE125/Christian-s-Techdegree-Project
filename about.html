        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> Most of my life, Oakland was the place I called home. I've lived here all my life, and I only moved twice. All my life, I've been shown as a smart kid. I remember back in elementary, the first person who finishes their beginning of the day math assignment was able to have free time while everyone else had to read on reading time. I always the one to be able to have free time. I guess math is easy for me. All my assignments had an A or a B on it. I had such good grades, I was able to go to a school camping trip, and only ten from my grade was able to go. The same thing goes for middle school, 9th and 10th grade. I always was an A and B student. I don't know why but, algebra was always an easy subject for me. I am now a sophomore at Arise Highschool, and you won't believe it, I'm passing all my classes (yay)! I'm mainly only doing this so I can show my parents that I'm a smart kid who was raised by amazing parents, and also so I can graduate with a good GPA and get into college. </p>
        <p>Some of my favorite things to do are spend time with my family/friends. I love my family, and I'll do anything for them. I'm very close with them, and they are my favorite people in the world. I also like to play videogames, especially with my friends.</p>
        <p>  Something I have overcome and made me the person I am now is losing weight. All my life, I was the "fat kid." Being bullied for my weight, but I never let it get to me. During quarantine, I had nothing better to do since we couldn't go anywhere so, I started working out. Losing 40 pounds and now weighing at 180. I feel so great, and I can fit in all my old clothes again. I felt like myself again.</p>

         <p>Making my parents proud is probably my #1 goal. They spend so much time working hard so I can have a great life, and I want to show them that I'm a smart kid who was raised by my great parents.</p>
